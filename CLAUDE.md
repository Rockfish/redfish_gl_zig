## Coding Style Guidelines

### General Principles

#### Write Idiomatic Zig
- Follow Zig conventions and idioms
- Use Zig's built-in language features appropriately
- Prefer Zig standard library patterns

#### Code for Clarity
- Write clear, readable code that expresses intent
- Choose descriptive variable and function names
- Structure code logically

#### Avoid Clever Code
- Prioritize readability over brevity
- Avoid obscure tricks or overly complex expressions
- Write code that other developers can easily understand

#### Function Parameters
- Avoid calling complex functions within function parameters
- Break down complex expressions into intermediate variables when it improves readability
- Exception: Simple field access is acceptable (see Variable Declarations below)

### Variable Declarations

#### Inline Field Access
Use inline field access in function calls instead of creating intermediate variables for simple cases:

**Preferred:**
```zig
const nodes = try allocator.alloc(gltf_types.Node, nodes_json.array.items.len);
```

**Avoid:**
```zig
const node_count = nodes_json.array.items.len;
const nodes = try allocator.alloc(gltf_types.Node, node_count);
```

This applies to scenarios where referencing nested fields directly in function calls is acceptable and improves code conciseness without sacrificing clarity.

## Project-Specific Guidelines

### Commit Guidelines
- NEVER add a signature at the end of commit messages

### Math Operations
- Use the math types and functions under `src/math/` when possible
- Prefer project-specific math implementations over external libraries
- This helps maintain consistency and reduces dependencies

### Model Loading
- glTF models should be loaded through `GltfAsset` in `src/core/asset_loader.zig`
- Textures are cached and managed centrally
- Use descriptive material names for texture associations

### Animation (glTF Native)
- **AnimationClip**: Reference glTF animations by index with `AnimationClip.init(animation_index, end_time, repeat_mode)`
- **Time-based**: Uses seconds instead of ticks for precise timing control
- **API Preserved**: All existing methods work unchanged (`playClip()`, `playTick()`, `updateAnimation()`)
- **Keyframe Support**: Linear interpolation for Vec3, spherical interpolation (slerp) for quaternions
- **Shader Integration**: Uses proper glTF terminology with `jointMatrices[100]` array for vertex shaders

### Error Handling
- Use Zig's error unions for fallible operations
- Prefer explicit error handling over assertions
- Log errors with context using `std.debug.print()`

   - Add support for morph target animations (weights)
   - Optimize keyframe lookup with binary search for large animations

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize keyframe lookup with binary search for large animations
   - Implement animation data caching for frequently used clips
   - Profile memory usage and optimize joint matrix calculations

4. **Future enhancements**:
   - Implement animation blending and transitions between clips
   - Add support for multiple models in a scene
   - Implement shadow mapping for better lighting
   - Add audio integration for ambient sounds
   - Create scene serialization system

### Development Notes
- **Active demo**: `examples/demo_app/main.zig` (build target: `demo_app`)
- **Shaders**: Located in `examples/demo_app/shaders/`
- **Math Library**: Pure Zig implementation in `src/math/` - add missing functions here
- **Asset Loading**: Use `GltfAsset` from `src/core/asset_loader.zig` for all model loading
- **glTF Analysis**: Use `core.gltf_report.GltfReport` for model inspection and debugging
- **Development Workflow**: Use `just dev` for auto-rebuild, `just pbr-dev` for shader work
- **Complete Guide**: See `DEVELOPMENT.md` for comprehensive workflow documentation
- **Watch Scripts**: Use `./scripts/watch-*.sh` for specialized development modes

## Coding Memories
- **NEVER add signatures to commit messages**
- When adding a large list of items within {} put a comma after that last item so that the zig formatter will fold the line nicely
- When writing an if else statement always include {}
- When using a pattern like self.arena.allocator(), I prefer calling it once to set a local variable at the top of the function then using the local variable instead of making multiple function calls. It reduces the clutter and makes the code easier to read.
- **Animation System Architecture**: When replacing complex legacy systems (like ASSIMP), maintain API compatibility by keeping the same public interfaces while completely rewriting the internal implementation. This allows existing code to work unchanged while modernizing the underlying technology.
- **Type Import Patterns**: Always import types at the top of files rather than using inline `@import()` in function parameters. This improves readability and makes dependencies explicit.
- **Wrapper Struct Avoidance**: Avoid unnecessary wrapper structs that just hold references to other data. Direct references are cleaner and reduce cognitive overhead (e.g., `gltf_asset: *const GltfAsset` vs `gltf_asset_ref: GltfAssetRef`).
- **Code Organization**: When refactoring, prefer moving functionality to appropriate modules over creating new structures. Extract functions cleanly from domain-specific modules to general-purpose ones.
- **Documentation Standards**: Add comprehensive struct documentation when dealing with complex conventions (e.g., matrix storage formats, coordinate systems).
