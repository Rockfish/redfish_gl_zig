# Plan 003: Basic PBR Shaders

**Status**: ðŸ”„ Active - Phase 2  
**Priority**: High  
**Started**: 2025-07-04  
**Phase 1 Completed**: 2025-07-06  
**Target**: 1-2 weeks total  

## Overview

Implement basic PBR (Physically Based Rendering) shaders to make models look realistic with proper materials. This focused plan adds essential visual quality without complex lighting systems, building on the GLB support and demo application foundation.

## Prerequisites

- [x] Plan 001 (GLB Support) completed
- [x] Plan 002 (Demo Application) completed
- [x] Stable model loading for both GLTF and GLB formats
- [x] Demo application working with basic shaders

## Phase 1: Shader Debugging Infrastructure âœ… COMPLETED

### Uniform Value Debugging System âœ…
- [x] **Shader Debug State**: Added `debug_enabled`, `debug_arena`, `debug_uniforms` to Shader struct
- [x] **Enable/Disable Functions**: `enableDebug()` and `disableDebug()` with proper memory management
- [x] **Clear Function**: `clearDebugUniforms()` resets captured values each frame
- [x] **Custom Debug Values**: `addDebugValue()` for manual insertion of debug info (camera pos, light pos, etc.)
- [x] **Formatted Output**: `dumpDebugUniforms()` provides console/buffer output with shader info and uniform counts
- [x] **Render Loop Integration**: 'G' key toggle for debug mode, 'U' key for debug dump output
- [x] **Automatic Capture**: `captureDebugUniform()` automatically captures all uniform values during `getUniformLocation()`
- [x] **Type Support**: Comprehensive type handling for bool, int, float, Vec2/3/4, Mat3/4, arrays
- [x] **Testing**: Validated with current shaders in demo application

### Implementation Details
- **Memory Management**: Uses ArenaAllocator for efficient debug data allocation/cleanup
- **Performance**: Debug capture only active when enabled, minimal overhead when disabled
- **User Interface**: Integrated with demo app controls ('G' toggle, 'U' dump)
- **Output Format**: Professional debug output with shader file names and uniform counts
- **Custom Values**: Real-time camera position, target, light position, and frame timing

### Remaining Phase 1 Items
- [x] Add framebuffer rendering for scene snapshots
- [x] Create timestamped bitmap and text file output system

- `DamagedHelmet/glTF-Binary/DamagedHelmet.glb` - Complex real-world PBR
- `FlightHelmet/glTF/FlightHelmet.gltf` - High-quality material reference

### Material Feature Tests
- `BoxTextured/glTF-Binary/BoxTextured.glb` - Basic texture mapping
- `NormalTangentTest/glTF-Binary/NormalTangentTest.glb` - Normal mapping
- `EmissiveStrengthTest/glTF-Binary/EmissiveStrengthTest.glb` - Emissive materials

### Quality Validation
- `SpecGlossVsMetalRough/glTF-Binary/SpecGlossVsMetalRough.glb` - Workflow comparison
- `Avocado/glTF-Binary/Avocado.glb` - Organic material testing

## Scope Limitations

**Not Included in This Plan** (moved to backlog):
- Multiple light sources
- Shadow mapping
- Environment mapping/IBL
- Post-processing effects
- Advanced material extensions
- Performance optimizations beyond basic level

## Notes & Decisions

**Focus**: This plan focuses on making models look good with proper materials rather than complex lighting. The goal is realistic material appearance with a single light source.

**Phase 1 Achievement**: Successfully implemented comprehensive shader debugging infrastructure with automatic uniform capture, real-time debugging controls, and professional output formatting. This provides excellent foundation for PBR shader development and validation.

**Current Phase**: Phase 2 - Core PBR Implementation with Cook-Torrance BRDF model.

**Development Tools Ready**: Enhanced workflow with `just pbr-dev` for shader development with validation, and robust debugging system for rapid PBR iteration.
