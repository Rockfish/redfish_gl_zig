#nd # Overview

Implement basic PBR (Physically Based Rendering) shaders to make models look realistic with proper materials. This focused plan adds essential visual quality without complex lighting systems, building on the GLB support and demo application foundation.

## Prerequisites

- [x] Plan 002 (Demo Application) completed
- [x] Stable model loading for both GLTF and GLB formats
- [x] Demo application working with basic shaders

## Phase 1: Shader Debugging Infrastructure âœ… COMPLETED

### Uniform Value Debugging System âœ…
- [x] **Shader Debug State**: Added `debug_enabled`, `debug_arena`, `debug_uniforms` to Shader struct
- [x] **Enable/Disable Functions**: `enableDebug()` and `disableDebug()` with proper memory management
- [x] **Clear Function**: `clearDebugUniforms()` resets captured values each frame
- [x] **Custom Debug Values**: `addDebugValue()` for manual insertion of debug info (camera pos, light pos, etc.)
- [x] **Formatted Output**: `dumpDebugUniforms()` provides console/buffer output with shader info and uniform counts
- [x] **Render Loop Integration**: 'G' key toggle for debug mode, 'U' key for debug dump output
- [x] **Automatic Capture**: `captureDebugUniform()` automatically captures all uniform values during `getUniformLocation()`
- [x] **Type Support**: Comprehensive type handling for bool, int, float, Vec2/3/4, Mat3/4, arrays
- [x] **Testing**: Validated with current shaders in demo application

### Implementation Details

## Notes & Decisions

**Focus**: This plan focuses on making models look good with proper materials rather than complex lighting. The goal is realistic material appearance with a single light source.

**Phase 1 Achievement**: Successfully implemented comprehensive shader debugging infrastructure with automatic uniform capture, real-time debugging controls, and professional output formatting. This provides excellent foundation for PBR shader development and validation.

**Phase 2 Achievement**: Successfully implemented complete Cook-Torrance PBR BRDF model with all essential features for realistic material rendering. The shaders now support full PBR workflow including metallic-roughness materials, normal mapping, and proper lighting.

**Current Phase**: Phase 3 - Material Quality and polish for production-ready PBR pipeline.

**Development Tools Ready**: Enhanced workflow with `just pbr-dev` for shader development with validation, and robust debugging system for rapid PBR iteration.
