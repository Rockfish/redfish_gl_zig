# Plan 003: Animation State Machine

**Status**: ðŸ“‹ Planned  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Started**: TBD  
**Target**: TBD  

## Overview

Implement a robust animation state machine system for character controllers and complex animated objects. This system will enable smooth transitions between animation clips, blending, and state-based animation logic.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Plan 001 (GLB Support and Demo) completed
- [ ] Plan 002 (Shader Improvements) completed or in progress
- [ ] Animation clip system working reliably
- [ ] Character models loading and displaying correctly

## Phase 1: State Machine Foundation

### Core State Machine
- [ ] Design state machine architecture
- [ ] Implement animation state class
- [ ] Add state transition system
- [ ] Create state machine manager
- [ ] Add event-driven state changes

### Animation Blending
- [ ] Implement linear interpolation between animations
- [ ] Add cross-fade transition support
- [ ] Create blend tree system for multiple animations
- [ ] Add additive animation support
- [ ] Implement animation layering

### State Definition System
- [ ] Create state configuration format (JSON/YAML)
- [ ] Add state validation and loading
- [ ] Implement state inheritance
- [ ] Add conditional state transitions
- [ ] Create visual state machine editor concepts

## Phase 2: Character Controller Integration

### Character States
- [ ] Implement idle animation state
- [ ] Add locomotion states (walk, run, sprint)
- [ ] Create directional movement states
- [ ] Add jump and fall states
- [ ] Implement combat/action states

### Input Integration
- [ ] Connect keyboard input to state machine
- [ ] Add mouse input for look direction
- [ ] Implement movement vector calculation
- [ ] Add state transition triggers
- [ ] Create input buffering system

### Movement Blending
- [ ] Implement 1D blend spaces (walk to run)
- [ ] Add 2D blend spaces (directional movement)
- [ ] Create turn-in-place animations
- [ ] Add movement prediction for smooth blending
- [ ] Implement root motion support

## Phase 3: Advanced Features

### Complex State Logic
- [ ] Add hierarchical state machines
- [ ] Implement parallel state execution
- [ ] Add state machine composition
- [ ] Create reusable state machine components
- [ ] Add debugging and visualization tools

### Animation Events
- [ ] Implement animation event markers
- [ ] Add frame-based event triggers
- [ ] Create sound effect integration points
- [ ] Add particle effect trigger system
- [ ] Implement gameplay event notifications

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Add animation LOD system
- [ ] Implement culling for off-screen characters
- [ ] Add bone mask optimization
- [ ] Create animation compression
- [ ] Optimize blend calculations

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Characters can transition smoothly between different animation states
- [ ] Input responsiveness feels natural and immediate
- [ ] Animation blending looks smooth and realistic
- [ ] State machine is data-driven and easily configurable
- [ ] Performance supports multiple animated characters
- [ ] System is extensible for different character types

## Testing Models for Animation Features

### Character Animation
- `Fox/glTF-Binary/Fox.glb` - Complex character with multiple animations
- `CesiumMan/glTF-Binary/CesiumMan.glb` - Standard rigged character
- `RiggedFigure/glTF-Binary/RiggedFigure.glb` - Simple rigged test case

### Animation Complexity
- `AnimatedCube/glTF/AnimatedCube.gltf` - Simple animation testing
- `InterpolationTest/glTF-Binary/InterpolationTest.glb` - Interpolation methods
- `MorphStressTest/glTF-Binary/MorphStressTest.glb` - Complex animation features

### Skeletal Systems
- `RecursiveSkeletons/glTF-Binary/RecursiveSkeletons.glb` - Complex hierarchies
- `SimpleSkin/glTF/SimpleSkin.gltf` - Basic skinning test
- `RiggedSimple/glTF-Binary/RiggedSimple.glb` - Simple rigging reference

## Example State Machine Configuration

```json
{
  "stateMachine": "PlayerCharacter",
  "defaultState": "Idle",
  "states": {
    "Idle": {
      "animation": "Player_Idle",
      "loop": true,
      "transitions": {
        "move_input": "Locomotion",
        "jump_input": "Jump"
      }
    },
    "Locomotion": {
      "blendSpace": "Movement2D",
      "animations": {
        "idle": "Player_Idle",
        "walk": "Player_Walk",
        "run": "Player_Run"
      },
      "transitions": {
        "no_input": "Idle",
        "jump_input": "Jump"
      }
    },
    "Jump": {
      "animation": "Player_Jump",
      "exitTime": 0.8,
      "transitions": {
        "land": "Idle"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Notes & Decisions

**TBD**: This plan will be refined based on lessons learned from animation loading and playback in Plans 001 and 002. The architecture may need adjustment based on the specific needs discovered during basic animation implementation.
