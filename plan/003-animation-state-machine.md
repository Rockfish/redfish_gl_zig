# Plan 003: Basic Animation System

**Status**: ðŸ“‹ Planned  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Started**: TBD  
**Target**: 1-2 weeks  

## Overview

Implement essential animation features including clip playback, simple blending, and basic state management. This focused plan enables characters to animate and respond to input with smooth transitions, building on the PBR rendering foundation.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Plan 001 (GLB Support and Demo) completed
- [ ] Plan 002 (Basic PBR Shaders) completed or in progress
- [ ] Character models loading and rendering correctly with animations

## Phase 1: Animation Clip System

### Core Animation Playback
- [ ] Enhance animation clip loading from glTF data
- [ ] Implement proper animation timing and interpolation
- [ ] Add animation loop modes (once, loop, ping-pong)
- [ ] Create animation speed control
- [ ] Add animation pause/resume functionality

### Animation Blending
- [ ] Implement linear interpolation between animation clips
- [ ] Add cross-fade transitions with configurable duration
- [ ] Create simple blend weight management
- [ ] Support simultaneous animation playback (upper/lower body)

## Phase 2: Basic State Management

### Simple State Machine
- [ ] Create basic animation state system (idle, walk, run)
- [ ] Implement state transition logic
- [ ] Add input-driven state changes
- [ ] Create smooth transitions between states
- [ ] Support state-specific animation settings

### Character Controller Integration
- [ ] Connect keyboard input to animation states
- [ ] Add movement speed affecting animation playback
- [ ] Implement directional movement awareness
- [ ] Create responsive state changes
- [ ] Add basic turn-in-place support

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Characters can play multiple animation clips smoothly
- [ ] Transitions between animations look natural and responsive
- [ ] Input controls feel immediate and intuitive
- [ ] Animation system works reliably with different character models
- [ ] Demo app showcases character movement and animation
- [ ] System is simple to use and extend for new animations

## Testing Models for Animation Features

### Character Animation
- `Fox/glTF-Binary/Fox.glb` - Complex character with multiple animations
- `CesiumMan/glTF-Binary/CesiumMan.glb` - Standard rigged character
- `BoxAnimated/glTF-Binary/BoxAnimated.glb` - Simple animated test case

### Animation Basics
- `AnimatedCube/glTF/AnimatedCube.gltf` - Simple animation testing
- `InterpolationTest/glTF-Binary/InterpolationTest.glb` - Interpolation validation
- `SimpleSkin/glTF/SimpleSkin.gltf` - Basic skinning test

### Skeletal Systems  
- `RiggedSimple/glTF-Binary/RiggedSimple.glb` - Simple rigging reference
- `RiggedFigure/glTF-Binary/RiggedFigure.glb` - Basic character rigging

## Scope Limitations

**Not Included in This Plan** (moved to backlog):
- Complex state machine hierarchies
- Animation events and gameplay integration
- 2D blend spaces and complex blending
- Animation LOD and performance optimization
- Root motion support
- Advanced character controller features

## Notes & Decisions

**Focus**: This plan focuses on essential animation functionality that enables basic character movement and state changes. Advanced features like complex blending and state hierarchies are deferred to later iterations.
