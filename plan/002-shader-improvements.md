# Plan 002: Advanced Shader System

**Status**: ðŸ“‹ Planned  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Started**: TBD  
**Target**: TBD  

## Overview

Enhance the rendering pipeline with improved PBR (Physically Based Rendering) shaders, lighting systems, and material support. This builds on the foundation of GLB support to provide more realistic and visually appealing rendering.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Plan 001 (GLB Support and Demo) completed
- [ ] Stable model loading for both GLTF and GLB formats
- [ ] Demo application working with basic shaders

## Phase 1: PBR Shader Foundation

### Shader Architecture
- [ ] Create modular shader system for different material types
- [ ] Implement proper PBR BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function)
- [ ] Add support for metallic-roughness workflow
- [ ] Implement specular-glossiness workflow support

### Material Property Support
- [ ] Enhance albedo/base color handling
- [ ] Improve normal mapping implementation
- [ ] Add proper metallic and roughness texture support
- [ ] Implement occlusion mapping
- [ ] Add emissive material support

### Lighting Model
- [ ] Implement multiple light source support
- [ ] Add directional lights (sun/moon)
- [ ] Add point lights with attenuation
- [ ] Add spot lights with cone falloff
- [ ] Implement ambient lighting/IBL basics

## Phase 2: Advanced Features

### Shadow System
- [ ] Implement shadow mapping for directional lights
- [ ] Add cascade shadow maps for large scenes
- [ ] Implement point light shadow cubes
- [ ] Add soft shadow techniques
- [ ] Optimize shadow map resolution and filtering

### Environment Mapping
- [ ] Add skybox/environment cube support
- [ ] Implement image-based lighting (IBL)
- [ ] Add reflection probe system
- [ ] Implement environment map filtering
- [ ] Add HDR environment support

### Post-Processing
- [ ] Implement tone mapping (ACES, Reinhard, etc.)
- [ ] Add gamma correction pipeline
- [ ] Implement basic bloom effect
- [ ] Add screen-space ambient occlusion (SSAO)
- [ ] Create exposure control system

## Phase 3: Optimization & Polish

### Performance
- [ ] Implement shader level-of-detail (LOD)
- [ ] Add frustum culling for lights
- [ ] Implement instanced rendering for repeated objects
- [ ] Add batch rendering optimizations
- [ ] Profile and optimize GPU performance

### Quality Improvements
- [ ] Add temporal anti-aliasing (TAA)
- [ ] Implement multi-sample anti-aliasing (MSAA) option
- [ ] Add anisotropic filtering support
- [ ] Improve texture compression handling
- [ ] Add mipmap generation and optimization

### Material Extensions
- [ ] Support glTF material extensions (clearcoat, transmission, etc.)
- [ ] Add support for blend modes
- [ ] Implement double-sided material rendering
- [ ] Add support for vertex colors
- [ ] Implement texture coordinate transformations

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Models render with realistic PBR materials
- [ ] Multiple light sources work correctly
- [ ] Shadows enhance scene depth and realism
- [ ] Environment mapping provides realistic reflections
- [ ] Performance remains acceptable on target hardware
- [ ] Demo app showcases visual improvements effectively

## Testing Models for Shader Features

### PBR Material Tests
- `MetalRoughSpheres/glTF-Binary/MetalRoughSpheres.glb` - Material variety
- `SpecGlossVsMetalRough/glTF-Binary/SpecGlossVsMetalRough.glb` - Workflow comparison
- `DamagedHelmet/glTF-Binary/DamagedHelmet.glb` - Complex PBR showcase

### Lighting Tests
- `LightsPunctualLamp/glTF-Binary/LightsPunctualLamp.glb` - Multiple light types
- `FlightHelmet/glTF/FlightHelmet.gltf` - Complex lighting scenarios

### Material Feature Tests
- `NormalTangentTest/glTF-Binary/NormalTangentTest.glb` - Normal mapping
- `TextureTransformTest/glTF-Binary/TextureTransformTest.glb` - UV transforms
- `EmissiveStrengthTest/glTF-Binary/EmissiveStrengthTest.glb` - Emissive materials

## Notes & Decisions

**TBD**: This plan will be detailed further once Plan 001 is completed and we have a solid foundation for loading and displaying models.
