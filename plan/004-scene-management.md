# Plan 004: Scene Management System

**Status**: ðŸ“‹ Planned  
**Priority**: Low  
**Started**: TBD  
**Target**: TBD  

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive scene management system that supports multiple models, hierarchical scene graphs, spatial optimization, and scene serialization. This transforms the engine from single-model rendering to full scene composition.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Plan 001 (GLB Support and Demo) completed
- [ ] Plan 002 (Shader Improvements) completed
- [ ] Plan 003 (Animation State Machine) completed or in progress
- [ ] Stable multi-model loading capability

## Phase 1: Scene Graph Foundation

### Hierarchical Scene Structure
- [ ] Implement scene node base class
- [ ] Add transform hierarchy system
- [ ] Create parent-child relationship management
- [ ] Add world vs local coordinate systems
- [ ] Implement scene graph traversal

### Node Types
- [ ] Create model/mesh node type
- [ ] Add light node implementation
- [ ] Implement camera node type
- [ ] Add empty transform node (groups)
- [ ] Create custom node extension system

### Transform System
- [ ] Implement efficient transform matrices
- [ ] Add dirty flag propagation
- [ ] Create transform caching
- [ ] Add relative transform calculations
- [ ] Implement transform animation support

## Phase 2: Spatial Optimization

### Culling Systems
- [ ] Implement frustum culling
- [ ] Add occlusion culling basic system
- [ ] Create distance-based LOD
- [ ] Add bounding volume hierarchies
- [ ] Implement spatial partitioning (octree/quadtree)

### Batching and Instancing
- [ ] Create static batch rendering
- [ ] Implement dynamic batching
- [ ] Add instanced rendering support
- [ ] Create material sorting for efficiency
- [ ] Add draw call optimization

### Memory Management
- [ ] Implement scene object pooling
- [ ] Add streaming for large scenes
- [ ] Create garbage collection for removed objects
- [ ] Add memory usage monitoring
- [ ] Implement texture atlasing

## Phase 3: Scene Composition & Tools

### Scene Serialization
- [ ] Design scene file format (JSON/binary)
- [ ] Implement scene loading/saving
- [ ] Add asset reference management
- [ ] Create scene validation system
- [ ] Add scene streaming support

### Scene Building Tools
- [ ] Create programmatic scene construction API
- [ ] Add scene composition helpers
- [ ] Implement scene template system
- [ ] Create scene merging capabilities
- [ ] Add procedural scene generation tools

### Multi-Scene Support
- [ ] Implement scene switching
- [ ] Add scene layering system
- [ ] Create scene transition effects
- [ ] Add background scene loading
- [ ] Implement scene state persistence

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Multiple models can be loaded and positioned in 3D space
- [ ] Scene hierarchy transforms work correctly
- [ ] Frustum culling improves performance for large scenes
- [ ] Scenes can be saved and loaded reliably
- [ ] Memory usage scales reasonably with scene complexity
- [ ] Draw calls are optimized through batching

## Testing Scenarios

### Multi-Model Scenes
- Load multiple models from assets_list.zig into single scene
- Test transform hierarchies with nested objects
- Verify culling with models outside camera view

### Complex Scenes
- `Sponza/glTF/Sponza.gltf` - Large architectural scene
- Multiple character models in same scene
- Mixed animated and static objects

### Performance Tests
- Hundreds of simple objects (Box.glb instances)
- Large scenes with multiple detail levels
- Memory usage with many texture-heavy models

## Example Scene Format

```json
{
  "scene": {
    "name": "Test Scene",
    "version": "1.0",
    "nodes": [
      {
        "id": "root",
        "type": "transform",
        "transform": [1,0,0,0, 0,1,0,0, 0,0,1,0, 0,0,0,1],
        "children": ["player", "environment"]
      },
      {
        "id": "player",
        "type": "model",
        "model": "Fox/glTF-Binary/Fox.glb",
        "transform": [1,0,0,0, 0,1,0,0, 0,0,1,0, 0,0,-5,1],
        "animation": "player_controller"
      },
      {
        "id": "environment",
        "type": "model", 
        "model": "Sponza/glTF/Sponza.gltf",
        "transform": [1,0,0,0, 0,1,0,0, 0,0,1,0, 0,0,0,1]
      }
    ],
    "lights": [
      {
        "type": "directional",
        "direction": [-0.3, -1.0, -0.3],
        "color": [1.0, 0.9, 0.8],
        "intensity": 3.0
      }
    ],
    "cameras": [
      {
        "name": "main",
        "position": [0, 5, 10],
        "target": [0, 0, 0],
        "fov": 45.0
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Notes & Decisions

**TBD**: This plan represents a significant expansion of engine capabilities. The specific architecture will depend heavily on performance requirements and use cases discovered during earlier plans.
