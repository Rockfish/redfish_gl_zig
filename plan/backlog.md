## Backlog Management

### Selection Criteria for Next Iteration
- Builds naturally on foundation layer
- Provides visible improvement to demo
- Doesn't require extensive infrastructure changes
- Can be completed in 1-2 weeks per cluster

### Priority Guidelines
1. **User-Visible Features First** - Things that improve the demo experience
2. **Performance When Needed** - Optimize when current approach becomes limiting
3. **Tools Last** - Build tools when manual processes become tedious

### Review Process
- After completing foundation layer (Plans 001-004), review this backlog
- Select 2-3 clusters for next iteration based on current needs
- Create new focused plan files for selected features
- Update this backlog with any new discoveries or requirements

## Notes
- Features in this backlog may be split, combined, or reprioritized based on actual development experience
- Some features may be moved back to foundation layer if they prove essential
- New features discovered during development should be added to appropriate clusters
