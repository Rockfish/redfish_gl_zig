## Development Philosophy

**Layered Feature Development**: Build horizontal layers of functionality across the engine rather than vertical feature silos. Each plan adds a bounded set of features that work together, keeping the engine functional and demonstrable at each iteration.

**Foundation Layer (Plans 001-005)**: Essential features for a working 3D engine
- ‚úÖ GLB format support (Plan 001)
- ‚úÖ Interactive demo application (Plan 002)
- üîÑ Basic PBR rendering (Plan 003)
- üìã Essential animation (Plan 004)
- üìã Multi-model scenes (Plan 005)

**Future Layers**: Advanced features will be selected from backlog after foundation completion.

## Current Focus Summary

**Active**: Plan 003 - Basic PBR Shaders  
**Phase**: Phase 1 - Core PBR Implementation  
**Next Task**: Implement basic PBR BRDF (Cook-Torrance model)  
**Target**: Realistic material rendering with proper PBR workflow  

**Foundation Layer Target**: 6-8 weeks total for Plans 001-005
**Each Plan Target**: 1-2 weeks maximum

**Key Dependencies**: Plans 001-002 completed (‚úÖ)  
**Blockers**: None identified  

## Session Notes

**2025-07-08**:
- **ASSIMP-Style Asset Loading Options**: Implemented comprehensive asset loading configuration system
- **Normal Generation System**: Created three-mode normal generation (skip/simple/accurate) for models with missing geometry data
- **Fox Model Lighting Fix**: Resolved Fox model's black appearance by automatically generating accurate normals from triangle geometry
- **Architecture Improvement**: Moved normal generation from mesh level to asset loader level for better separation of concerns
- **Configuration API**: Added `setNormalGenerationMode()` following ASSIMP patterns - set options before calling `buildModel()`
- **Memory Management**: Efficient HashMap storage with composite keys for pre-generated normals
- **Extensible Foundation**: Established pattern for additional asset loading options (texture settings, optimization flags, etc.)
- **Development Impact**: Robust foundation for handling glTF models with incomplete or missing geometry data
- **Test Validation**: Successfully tested with Fox model showing "Generated accurate normals for mesh 0 primitive 0 (1728 vertices)"

**2025-07-06**: 
- **Screenshot & Debug System**: Implemented comprehensive F12 screenshot and shader debugging system
