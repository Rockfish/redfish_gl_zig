## ‚ùå Cancelled/Postponed

- None currently

## Development Philosophy

**Layered Feature Development**: Build horizontal layers of functionality across the engine rather than vertical feature silos. Each plan adds a bounded set of features that work together, keeping the engine functional and demonstrable at each iteration.

**Foundation Layer (Plans 001-005)**: Essential features for a working 3D engine
- ‚úÖ GLB format support (Plan 001)
- ‚úÖ Interactive demo application (Plan 002)
- üîÑ Basic PBR rendering (Plan 003)
- üìã Essential animation (Plan 004)
- üìã Multi-model scenes (Plan 005)

**Future Layers**: Advanced features will be selected from backlog after foundation completion.

## Current Focus Summary

**Active**: Plan 003 - Basic PBR Shaders  
**Phase**: Phase 1 - Core PBR Implementation  
**Next Task**: Implement basic PBR BRDF (Cook-Torrance model)  
**Target**: Realistic material rendering with proper PBR workflow  

**Foundation Layer Target**: 6-8 weeks total for Plans 001-005
**Each Plan Target**: 1-2 weeks maximum

**Key Dependencies**: Plans 001-002 completed (‚úÖ)  
**Blockers**: None identified  

## Session Notes

**2025-07-05**: 
- **Code Organization**: Completed refactoring of Transform/Mat4 architecture for better separation of concerns
- **Documentation Enhancement**: Added comprehensive column-major matrix documentation
- **Development Tools**: Implemented comprehensive glTF inspection and reporting system
- **Legacy Cleanup**: Removed `examples/zgltf_port` after modernizing functionality
- **Project Maintenance**: Enhanced git commit templates and improved code organization standards
- **Foundation Strength**: Robust development tools and clean architecture ready for Plan 003

**2025-07-04**: 
- **Plan 002 completed**: Interactive demo application fully implemented with enhanced model statistics
- **Final UI feature**: Added comprehensive model statistics (vertices, primitives, textures, animations)
- **Plan 003 activated**: Basic PBR Shaders now active for realistic material rendering
- **Foundation progress**: 2 of 5 foundation plans completed, strong base for advanced features
- Ready to begin PBR implementation with Cook-Torrance BRDF model

**2024-06-26**: 
- **Plan reorganization**: Separated GLB support from demo application into dedicated plans
- **Plan 001 completed**: GLB format support with binary parsing, alignment fixes, and integration tests
- **Plan 002 active**: Comprehensive demo application with model cycling and intelligent camera
- Updated plan numbering: 002‚Üí003, 003‚Üí004, 004‚Üí005 to accommodate demo plan
- Ready to begin demo implementation leveraging existing examples/demo_app/ structure

**2024-06-25**: 
- Restructured planning system for iterative, layered development
- Created backlog.md with advanced features moved from original plans
- Simplified Plans 002-004 to focus on essential features only
- Each plan now targets 1-2 weeks with specific, bounded scope
- Foundation layer approach ensures continuous progress and working demos
