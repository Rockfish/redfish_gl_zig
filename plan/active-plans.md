  - GLB binary format parsing with chunk extraction
  - Asset loader integration with format routing
  - Binary data alignment and validation tests
  - Integration test passing with Box.glb sample model

- **Architecture Refactoring** - Completed 2024-06-24 (commit 6725b17)
  - Separated glTF parsing from rendering components
  - Moved core modules out of gltf/ directory
  - Enhanced CLAUDE.md with project documentation

## ❌ Cancelled/Postponed

- None currently

## Development Philosophy

**Layered Feature Development**: Build horizontal layers of functionality across the engine rather than vertical feature silos. Each plan adds a bounded set of features that work together, keeping the engine functional and demonstrable at each iteration.

**Foundation Layer (Plans 001-005)**: Essential features for a working 3D engine
- ✅ GLB format support (Plan 001)
- 🔄 Interactive demo application (Plan 002)
- 📋 Basic PBR rendering (Plan 003)
- 📋 Essential animation (Plan 004)
- 📋 Multi-model scenes (Plan 005)

**Future Layers**: Advanced features will be selected from backlog after foundation completion.

## Current Focus Summary

**Active**: Plan 002 - Demo Application  
**Phase**: Implementation of 8-step plan  
**Next Task**: Step 1 - Model management system with cycling functionality  
**Target**: Interactive demo with 15 curated models by 2024-07-08  

**Foundation Layer Target**: 6-8 weeks total for Plans 001-005
**Each Plan Target**: 1-2 weeks maximum

**Key Dependencies**: Plan 001 GLB support (✅ completed)  
**Blockers**: None identified  

## Session Notes

**2024-06-26**: 
- **Plan reorganization**: Separated GLB support from demo application into dedicated plans
- **Plan 001 completed**: GLB format support with binary parsing, alignment fixes, and integration tests
- **Plan 002 active**: Comprehensive demo application with model cycling and intelligent camera
- Updated plan numbering: 002→003, 003→004, 004→005 to accommodate demo plan
- Ready to begin demo implementation leveraging existing examples/new_gltf/ structure

**2024-06-25**: 
- Restructured planning system for iterative, layered development
- Created backlog.md with advanced features moved from original plans
- Simplified Plans 002-004 to focus on essential features only
- Each plan now targets 1-2 weeks with specific, bounded scope
- Foundation layer approach ensures continuous progress and working demos
