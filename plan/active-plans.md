## Development Philosophy

**Layered Feature Development**: Build horizontal layers of functionality across the engine rather than vertical feature silos. Each plan adds a bounded set of features that work together, keeping the engine functional and demonstrable at each iteration.

- ‚úÖ GLB format support (Plan 001)
- ‚úÖ Interactive demo application (Plan 002)  
- ‚úÖ Basic PBR rendering (Plan 003)
- üìã Essential animation (Plan 004)
- üìã Multi-model scenes (Plan 005)

**Advanced Features Implemented**:
- ‚úÖ Cubic spline animation interpolation system
- ‚úÖ Enhanced WeightedAnimation system with blending
- ‚úÖ Complete ASSIMP to glTF migration (game_angrybot)
- ‚úÖ Multi-game architecture (angrybot, level_01)
- ‚úÖ Movement system precision improvements

**Future Layers**: Advanced features will be selected from backlog after foundation completion.

**Phase**: Game development and advanced animation systems  
**Focus Areas**: Multi-game architecture, cubic spline animation, movement systems  
**Status**: Foundation layer completed (Plans 001-003), advanced features implemented
