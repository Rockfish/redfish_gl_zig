# Plan 002: Interactive Demo Application

**Status**: üîÑ Active  
**Priority**: High  
**Started**: 2024-06-26  
**Target**: 2024-07-08  

## Overview

Create an interactive demo application that showcases the engine's GLB and glTF loading capabilities. The demo will feature model cycling, intelligent camera positioning, and a user-friendly interface that demonstrates both formats working seamlessly together.

## Prerequisites

- [x] Plan 001: GLB Format Support (completed)
- [x] Core asset loader with GLB support working
- [x] Integration tests passing for GLB loading

## Current Code Analysis

The existing `examples/demo_app/` structure provides a solid foundation:
- **main.zig**: Basic window setup with hardcoded model loading
- **state.zig**: Comprehensive input handling and camera system with multiple motion types
- **run_app.zig**: Main application loop with model loading and rendering
- **render.zig**: Shader uniform setup (currently for external zgltf, needs adaptation)
- **assets_list.zig**: Comprehensive model path lists (108 glTF + 79 GLB models)
- **shaders/**: Basic, PBR, and player shaders available

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Model Management System ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- [x] Create model metadata structure `{path, name, format, category, description}`
- [x] Prioritize model order: simple ‚Üí complex ‚Üí animated
- [x] Add `current_model_index: usize` to State struct
- [x] Implement 'n' (next) and 'b' (back) key handlers in `state.zig`
- [x] Add model loading state tracking
- [x] Handle wrap-around at list boundaries

**Curated Model Selection**:
- **Simple**: Box.glb, BoxTextured.glb, Triangle.gltf (3 models)
- **Animated**: Fox.glb, CesiumMan.glb, BoxAnimated.glb (3 models)  
- **Complex**: DamagedHelmet.glb, FlightHelmet.gltf, BrainStem.glb (3 models)
- **Format comparison**: Duck.gltf vs Duck.glb, Avocado.gltf vs Avocado.glb (4 models)
- **Edge cases**: Unicode‚ù§‚ôªTest.glb, BoxInterleaved.glb (2 models)

### Step 4: User Interface Enhancements ‚úÖ COMPLETED (2024-07-01)
**Goal**: Add informative display and model information

**Core Features Implemented**:
- [x] Create `ui_display.zig` with comprehensive overlay system
- [x] Current model info display: "3/15: Box (GLB) - Simple geometry test"
- [x] Help system with key binding display ('H' key toggle)
- [x] Model category information (Simple/Animated/Complex)

- [x] Format color coding (GLB/glTF visual distinction)
- [x] Custom font integration (FiraCode, Roboto via content_dir)
- [x] Proper window positioning using actual framebuffer size
- [x] **Camera information display** (position, target, motion/view/projection types)
- [x] **Real-time state updates** for all camera settings
- [x] **Input system improvements** - fire-once behavior for discrete actions
- [x] **Architecture cleanup** - Camera owns all camera-related state

**UI Layout (4 overlay windows)**:
- **Model Info** (top-left): Current model, format, category, description
- **Performance** (top-right): FPS, frame time, load time
- **Camera Info** (top-right, below performance): Position, target, motion/view/projection types
- **Help** (bottom-left): Complete control reference, toggle with 'H'

**Key Controls**:
- **Model Navigation**: N/B (next/previous), F (frame-to-fit), R (reset camera)
- **Camera Modes**: 1/2 (LookTo/LookAt), 4/5 (Perspective/Orthographic), 6-9 (Motion types)
- **Animation**: 0 (reset), +/- (next/previous animation)
- **Display Toggles**: H (help), C (camera info)
- **Debug**: P (output position), T (time debug)

**Technical Improvements**:
- **FrameCounter modernization**: Unified `src/core/frame_counter.zig` with external access to FPS/frame_time
- **Input processing**: All discrete actions use `key_processed` check for proper fire-once behavior
- **State management**: Removed duplicate fields (`view_type`, `projection_type`) from State
- **Camera ownership**: Camera now owns `projection_type` with `setPerspective()`/`setOrthographic()` methods
- **Font loading**: Uses `content_dir` from build_options for portable font paths
- **Dynamic positioning**: UI windows positioned using real window dimensions, not hardcoded values

**Files Modified/Created**:
- **NEW**: `examples/demo_app/ui_display.zig` - Complete UI overlay system
- **UPDATED**: `examples/demo_app/state.zig` - Fire-once input, removed duplicate state
- **UPDATED**: `examples/demo_app/run_app.zig` - UI integration
- **UPDATED**: `src/core/frame_counter.zig` - Improved API with external access
- **UPDATED**: `src/core/camera.zig` - Added projection_type ownership and methods
- **UPDATED**: `src/core/main.zig` - Exports FrameCounter
- **UPDATED**: `.gitignore` - Added imgui.ini exclusion

### Step 5: Error Handling & Polish

### Step 7: Animation System & Transform Fixes ‚úÖ COMPLETED (2024-07-01)
**Goal**: Implement glTF animation support and fix core transform hierarchy issues

**Phase 7A: Critical Matrix Math Fixes** ‚úÖ
- [x] **Matrix multiplication bug fix**: Fixed `Mat4.mulMat4()` to use column-major multiplication matching cglm
- [x] **Matrix-vector multiplication fix**: Fixed `Mat4.mulVec4()` to use column-major matrix-vector multiplication
- [x] **Transform hierarchy debugging**: Added debug functions to analyze node transform issues
- [x] **Lantern model fix**: Resolved positioning issues with multi-node models (180¬∞ Y rotation + child translations)
- [x] **Column-major compliance audit**: Verified all Mat4 and Mat3 functions follow cglm conventions
- [x] **Debug function refactoring**: Moved debug functions outside Model struct for cleaner architecture

**Phase 7B: Animation System (Future)** 
- [ ] Animation system integration from angry_gl_zig concepts
- [ ] Support glTF animation playback for skeletal animations
- [ ] Add animation controls ('=' next, '-' prev, '0' reset)
- [ ] Implement animation state tracking and UI display
- [ ] Test with animated models (Fox.glb, CesiumMan.glb, BoxAnimated.glb)
- [ ] Add animation info to UI overlay (current clip, playback state)
- [ ] Handle models with multiple animations
- [ ] Implement animation blending transitions (future enhancement)

**Critical Bug Fixes Completed**:
1. **Transform Hierarchy Issue**: Fixed critical matrix multiplication bug where parent rotations weren't being applied to child translations
2. **Root Cause**: `Mat4.mulMat4()` was using row-major multiplication instead of column-major, causing global transforms to become (0,0,0)
3. **Solution**: Rewrote matrix multiplication to match cglm's `glm_mat4_mul` implementation exactly
4. **Validation**: Lantern model now renders correctly with proper 180¬∞ Y rotation + child positioning

**Architecture Improvements**:
- Debug functions moved to standalone functions outside Model struct
- `debugPrintModelNodeStructure(model: *Model)` - Model node analysis
- `debugMatrixMultiplication()` - Matrix multiplication testing
- `debugPrintNode()` - Recursive node printing helper
- All matrix functions verified against cglm reference implementation

**Implementation Notes**:
- Matrix math now fully compatible with cglm column-major conventions
- Transform accumulation working correctly for complex multi-node models
- Debug infrastructure in place for future animation development
- Ready for skeletal animation implementation once core transforms are stable
