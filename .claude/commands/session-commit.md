Commit files with a clear, structured commit message following this format:

**Structure:**
- Start with a concise description (under 72 characters, imperative mood)
- Follow with bullet points listing specific changes
- Use imperative mood throughout (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Focus on what and why, not how
- NEVER add a signature or author attribution (Git handles this automatically)

**Example format:**
```
Add shader debugging system with uniform capture

- Implement uniform value collection during rendering
- Add enable/disable functions for debug mode
- Create formatted output for debugging uniform values
- Integrate keyboard controls for debug operations
```
