## Recent Changes

### 2025-07-08 - ASSIMP-Style Asset Loading Options ðŸ”§
- **Asset Loading Architecture Refactoring**: Implemented ASSIMP-style configuration options for glTF asset loading
- **Normal Generation System**: Created comprehensive normal generation system with three modes:
  - **Skip Mode**: Uses shader fallback lighting for models without normals
  - **Simple Mode**: Generates uniform upward-facing normals (0, 1, 0) for all vertices
  - **Accurate Mode**: Calculates proper normals from triangle geometry using cross products
- **Configuration API**: Added `setNormalGenerationMode()` method following ASSIMP patterns
  - Usage: `gltf_asset.setNormalGenerationMode(.accurate)` before calling `buildModel()`
  - Centralized preprocessing at asset level, not during mesh creation
  - Automatic detection - only generates normals for mesh primitives that lack them
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Moved `NormalGenerationMode` enum from `mesh.zig` to `asset_loader.zig`
  - Added `generated_normals` HashMap to `GltfAsset` with composite keys `(mesh_index << 32 | primitive_index)`
  - Implemented `generateMissingNormals()` called during `buildModel()` preprocessing
  - Updated mesh initialization to use pre-generated normals via `getGeneratedNormals()`
  - Moved normal generation functions to asset loader for centralized processing
- **Fox Model Lighting Fix**: Resolved Fox model's black appearance from certain angles
  - Fox model lacks normal vectors in glTF data, causing lighting failures
  - Accurate normal generation now automatically creates proper normals from triangle geometry
  - Test output: "Generated accurate normals for mesh 0 primitive 0 (1728 vertices)"
- **Extensible Pattern**: Established foundation for additional asset loading options (future texture settings, optimization flags, etc.)
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/core/asset_loader.zig` - Added normal generation system and ASSIMP-style configuration
  - `src/core/mesh.zig` - Removed duplicate normal generation, updated to use pre-generated normals
  - `examples/demo_app/run_app.zig` - Configured accurate normal generation for all models
- **Memory Management**: Pre-generated normals stored efficiently in HashMap, cleaned up with asset lifecycle
- **Development Impact**: Provides robust foundation for handling models with missing or incomplete geometry data
