### 2025-07-11 - ASSIMP to glTF Migration System ðŸš€
- **Complete Custom Texture Assignment System**: Implemented comprehensive texture assignment system for glTF models
  - **Purpose**: Port ASSIMP-based projects (like `game_angrybot`) to use glTF models with manual texture assignment
  - **Key Innovation**: Bridge ASSIMP's texture-type approach with glTF's uniform-name approach for maximum flexibility
- **Custom Texture Architecture**:
  - **TextureConfig**: Comprehensive texture configuration (filter, wrap, flip_v, gamma_correction)
  - **CustomTexture**: Mesh-specific texture assignments with on-demand loading and caching
  - **Integration**: Seamlessly integrated into `GltfAsset` as equivalent to ASSIMP's `ModelBuilder`
  - **Override System**: Custom textures override material textures with texture units starting at 10
- **API Design Philosophy**:
  - ASSIMP version: `try builder.addTexture("Player", texture_diffuse, "Textures/Player_D.tga")`
  - glTF version: `try gltf_asset.addTexture("Player", "texture_diffuse", "Textures/Player_D.tga", texture_config)`
  - Maintains similar simplicity while providing more flexibility with uniform names
- **Core Implementation Features**:
  - **Memory Management**: Arena-based allocation with proper GL object cleanup

  - Proper API compatibility: `model.update_animation()`, `camera.movement.processMovement()`
- **Technical Innovation**: Solves the critical gap between ASSIMP's manual texture control and glTF's material system
  - Allows models with UV coordinates but no material definitions to receive textures
  - Maintains ASSIMP-style developer control while leveraging glTF's modern architecture
  - Essential foundation for porting existing ASSIMP-based games to glTF

### 2025-07-08 - ASSIMP-Style Asset Loading Options ðŸ”§
- **Asset Loading Architecture Refactoring**: Implemented ASSIMP-style configuration options for glTF asset loading
- **Normal Generation System**: Created comprehensive normal generation system with three modes:
  - **Skip Mode**: Uses shader fallback lighting for models without normals
  - **Simple Mode**: Generates uniform upward-facing normals (0, 1, 0) for all vertices
  - **Accurate Mode**: Calculates proper normals from triangle geometry using cross products
- **Configuration API**: Added `setNormalGenerationMode()` method following ASSIMP patterns
  - Usage: `gltf_asset.setNormalGenerationMode(.accurate)` before calling `buildModel()`
  - Centralized preprocessing at asset level, not during mesh creation
  - Automatic detection - only generates normals for mesh primitives that lack them
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Moved `NormalGenerationMode` enum from `mesh.zig` to `asset_loader.zig`
  - Added `generated_normals` HashMap to `GltfAsset` with composite keys `(mesh_index << 32 | primitive_index)`
  - Implemented `generateMissingNormals()` called during `buildModel()` preprocessing
  - Updated mesh initialization to use pre-generated normals via `getGeneratedNormals()`
  - Moved normal generation functions to asset loader for centralized processing
- **Fox Model Lighting Fix**: Resolved Fox model's black appearance from certain angles
  - Fox model lacks normal vectors in glTF data, causing lighting failures
  - Accurate normal generation now automatically creates proper normals from triangle geometry
  - Test output: "Generated accurate normals for mesh 0 primitive 0 (1728 vertices)"
- **Extensible Pattern**: Established foundation for additional asset loading options (future texture settings, optimization flags, etc.)
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/core/asset_loader.zig` - Added normal generation system and ASSIMP-style configuration
  - `src/core/mesh.zig` - Removed duplicate normal generation, updated to use pre-generated normals
